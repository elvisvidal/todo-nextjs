# TODO NextJS

With the evolution of internet and it's various tools, very often, I see myself learning much easier with a hands on approach, increasing the difficulty by chunks of functionality and complexity.

Dispite of the simplicity of a todo-app, it is a great first project to implement:

- Simple well known interface: common UX.
- Basic UI components powered with CSS framework: TailwindCSS.
- Simple navigation: list page and edit page.
- CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete.
- API response handling: success and error.
- End-to-end and Component tests.

- [AnalogJS (Angular)](https://github.com/elvisvidal/todo-analogjs)

# Next

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
